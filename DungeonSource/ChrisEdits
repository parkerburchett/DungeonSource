First I got rid of the need for keyboard class. I replace all uses of it with 
Scanner. 

Cleaned up the code in playAgain, added a scanner.

removed a bunch of switch cases, because he said that he likes if else's more.

made a getChoice that handels exceptions and ranges, removes the code from 
other methods and makes them much more readable.

moved printMenu to its own menu to clean up the methods
